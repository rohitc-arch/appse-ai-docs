This guide will help you connect your BigCommerce store to APPSe AI by using your **Store Hash** and **API Token**.

Once connected, you will be able to use BigCommerce within your workflows—for syncing orders, updating inventory, triggering events, and more.

## Required Fields

The following fields are required to authenticate your BigCommerce account:

| Field        | Description                                      |
|--------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Store Hash   | Unique identifier for your BigCommerce store     |
| API Token    | Token used to authenticate API requests          |

---

## Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Find Your Store Hash

1. Log in to your BigCommerce admin dashboard.  
2. In your browser's address bar, you will see a URL like:  
   `https://store-abc123.mybigcommerce.com/manage/dashboard`

3. The value after `store-` is your **Store Hash**.  
   Example: `abc123`

4. Copy and securely store the **Access Token** — it will not be shown again.

You will now have your **Access Token** for use within the APPSe AI platform.

## Test Your Credential

Once both **Store Hash** and **API Token** are entered into the credential form, use the **Save** button to store your configurations.

- If successful, your BigCommerce integration will be ready to use.
- If unsuccessful, try the following solutions:
   * Ensure your Store Hash and token are correct and that the scopes are properly set.
   * Ensure that your API token has the required scope for the Customers endpoint. Missing or insufficient permissions may result in authentication or data access errors. Refer to the OAuth scope recommendation table above.

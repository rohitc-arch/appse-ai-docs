In APPSe AI, credentials are the secure connection details that enable your automations to interact with external applications. As an integration platform (iPaaS), APPSe AI leverages these credentials to facilitate seamless data flow between various systems — whether it’s your AI, ERP, CRM, eCommerce, or other apps.

Properly configured credentials are essential for building robust and reliable process flows within your automation pipeline.

## How to Create a Credential

To create a new credential in APPSe AI, follow these simple steps:

1. **Click the "Add Credential" button** located in the Credentials section.

> ⚙️ The platform will automatically **validate** the credentials before saving. If the connection is successful, the credential will be securely stored and available for use in your process flows.

### Post-Creation Actions

After creating a credential, you can perform the following actions:

- **Edit**: Modify the existing credential details and revalidate them.
- **Rename**: Change only the **Connection Name** (this does not trigger any validation).
- **Delete**: Permanently remove the credential from your workspace.

### Credential Status Indicator

Each credential is accompanied by a **status icon** that provides a quick visual cue about its validity:

- **Green Tick Icon**: Indicates that the credential is valid and has passed the latest verification.
- **Red Exclamation Icon**: Signals an issue with the credential — it may be expired, revoked, or misconfigured.

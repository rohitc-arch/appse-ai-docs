## Working with Actors

Actors are the core building blocks of the Apify platform. They are serverless cloud programs that can perform arbitrary web scraping, automation, or data processing tasks. Follow the steps below to work with actors in your appse.ai workflows.

### Step 1: Go to Apify Store

Navigate to the [Apify Store](https://apify.com/store) to browse and discover actors that suit your needs.

### Step 2: Add Actor to Your Account

Search for your specific actor and add it to your Apify account. For example, you can search for web scrapers, data extractors, or automation tools.

### Step 3: Find the Actor Name

Once you've added an actor, note down the actor name. You'll need this to reference the actor in appse.ai.

### Step 4: Check Input Requirements

Review the actor's documentation to understand the input requirements needed to run it. Each actor has specific input parameters that must be provided for successful execution. Click on **JSON** to find a sample input.

### Step 5: Add a New Node to your workflow

Go to appse.ai and add a new Apify node to your workflow.

### Step 6: Use Get Actors to Find All Actors

Use the **Get Actors** action to retrieve a list of all actors in your Apify account. The JSON response provides the username and actor name for each actor.
The response will include details about your actors:

Please note the name and username from the fields in JSON. When requesting an actor, the actor name must be in the format `username~actor-name`.

### Step 7: Run an Actor

To execute an actor, select the **Run Actor** action. When selected, you'll be asked to choose an actor from your account.

:::tip Manual Actor Execution

In case you want to execute the actor manually, you need to specify the actor in the format: `username~actor-name`

For example: `apify~google-search-scraper`

:::

### Step 8: Configure Input and Run

Provide the required input parameters and any optional fields needed to run the actor successfully. The input structure depends on the specific actor you're using.

Once configured, your actor will execute and return the results to your workflow.

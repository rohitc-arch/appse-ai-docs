---

### Step 6: Configure Application

3. Paste it into **Authorized Redirect URIs**
4. Click **Create**

<img src="/img/credentials/zoho-books/createnewclient.png" alt="Create new client" width="700"/>

:::warning
The Callback API URL must exactly match the value provided by appse.ai, otherwise authorization will fail.
:::

---

### Step 7: Configure Multi-Data Center Settings

Go to **Settings** and enable **Use the same OAuth credentials for all data centers**:

<img src="/img/credentials/zoho-books/data_center_settings.png" alt="data_center_settings" width="700"/>

Click **OK** to confirm:

<img src="/img/credentials/zoho-books/save_data_center_settings.png" alt="save_data_center_settings" width="700"/>

:::info
This setting allows the same OAuth credentials to work across Zoho data centers.
:::

---

### Step 8: Copy Credentials

Copy the generated **Client ID** and **Client Secret**:

<img src="/img/credentials/zoho-books/client_credential.png" alt="client_credentials" width="700"/>

:::warning
Keep your Client Secret secure and do not share it publicly.
:::

---

### Step 9: Paste Credentials

### Step 11: Grant Permissions

<img src="/img/credentials/zoho-books/grant_permissions.png" alt="Grant Permissions" width="700"/>

:::info
Granting permissions allows appse.ai to access Zoho Books data based on the configured scope.

If the details are valid, appse.ai will complete the OAuth authorization flow and save the credential successfully.

If validation fails, an error message will be displayed so you can correct the configuration and try again.

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Webhook Configuration

To receive data from **Zoho Books**, you must use Webhooks. This is required because **Zoho Books** does not support date-time filters, making it impossible to check for new data using standard polling methods. Instead, you must configure **Zoho Books** to push data directly to your appse ai flow via Webhooks.

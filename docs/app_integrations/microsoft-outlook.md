### Step 1. Choose Your Account

To add an Outlook credential, simply enter a connection name and click the Save and Authorize button.

This will open a pop-up window displaying a list of your Microsoft accounts, from which you can select the account you want to use.
Then you can proceed by selecting the **Microsoft account or organization** you want to connect with Appse AI.

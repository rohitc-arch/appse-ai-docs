# Active Flows

**Active Flows** represent the number of workflows that can be enabled and running concurrently at any given time. Each plan includes a fixed concurrent flow limit — once that limit is reached, you cannot activate additional workflows until you either deactivate an existing one or purchase more flows.

## Flow Limits by Plan

| Plan       | Active Flows Included                                  |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Free       | Not included — workflow execution requires a paid plan |
| Starter    | 3 flows                                                |
| Growth     | 5 flows                                                |
| Enterprise | 5 flows                                                |

You can monitor your current active flow usage at any time by navigating to **Billing → Usage → Active Flows**.

## What Happens When the Flow Limit Is Reached

:::warning
When your active flow limit is reached, **you will not be able to activate any additional workflows**. Existing active workflows continue to run unaffected.
:::

Attempting to activate a workflow beyond your plan's limit displays the following prompt:

> _"Your plan has reached the active Flow limit. Buy more Flows to keep activating workflows."_

<br/>

To activate a new workflow, you can either:

- **Deactivate** an existing active workflow to free up a slot, or
- **Buy more flows** to increase your concurrent limit.

## Buying Extra Flows

You can increase your concurrent flow limit at any time by purchasing additional flows.

### Pricing

Extra flows are priced at **$30 per flow per month**, billed annually at **$360 per flow per year**.

- **Due today**: The charge is prorated based on the number of months remaining in your current billing period.
- **From next renewal**: The extra flows are permanently added to your plan and billed as part of your annual subscription going forward.

:::info
Unlike AI Credit packs, extra flows are a **recurring add-on** — not a one-time purchase. Once bought, they are included in your plan at every renewal.
:::

### How to Buy Extra Flows

1. Navigate to **Billing → Usage** in the platform.
2. Scroll to the **Active Flows** section and click **Buy more**.
3. Enter the number of additional flows you need.
4. Review the **Due Today** and **From Next Renewal** cost summary.
5. Agree to the Terms & Conditions and click **Proceed to Checkout**.

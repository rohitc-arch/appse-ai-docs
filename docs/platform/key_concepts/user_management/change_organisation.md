# Change Organisation
 
## Introduction
 
The **Change Organisation** feature in **appse ai** allows users to switch between different organisations linked to their account. This is especially useful if you are part of multiple organisations and need to work within different workspaces.
 
## Important
 
- Users who have access to **multiple organisations** will see a **'Switch Organisation'** option, allowing them to move between organisations easily.
 
- Users who have access to **only one organisation** will not see this option, as there is no organisation to switch to.
 
## How to Change Organisation
 
1. From the sidebar, go to the user panel at the bottom-left. Click the three-dot (⋮) menu next to your profile name and select **Change organization**.

# Invite Users

## Introduction

Inviting users allows you to collaborate with your team by granting them access to your organization in **appse ai**.

## As an Organisation Admin

As an admin, you can:

1. Invite new members to your organization.
2. Remove existing users such as editors or viewers when access is no longer required.
3. Change user roles, for example, from **'Viewer** to **Editor'** or **'Editor** to **Viewer'**.
4. Note that admins cannot leave the organization on their own.

## How to Invite a User

1. From the sidebar, go to the user panel at the bottom-left. Click the three-dot (⋮) menu next to your profile name and select **Settings**.

title: Base64 Decode
---

The Base64 Decode node in Appse AI is a built-in node that allows you to convert a Base64 string back into its original format. Many applications and APIs return files in a Base64 string format. This node helps decode that data into a text format that can be used in other nodes in your workflow.

## Configuration

### Type
Select the type of file you want to decode.

### Base64 String
Enter or map the field containing the Base64-encoded string that you want to decode. Make sure the string is properly encoded — invalid or incomplete Base64 data will result in an error.

## Steps to Use the Base64 Decode Node

1. From the selection screen, choose the Base64 Decode node.

5. Click Continue, then Run the node to decode the data.

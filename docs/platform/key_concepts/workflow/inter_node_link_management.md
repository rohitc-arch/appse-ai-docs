# Inter-Node Link Management

The Inter-node Link Management option appears when you hover over the connection line between two nodes on the canvas. It allows users to **add a new node, unlink the connection, or add a branch** between connected nodes. Users can also **link two nodes** by dragging a connection from one node to another, creating a flow between them.

## 1. **Add a new node**  
   If a user wants to add a new node between two connected nodes, they can select “Add a Node”, which opens the app selection screen to choose and insert the node they want at that point in the workflow.

## 2. **Add new branch**  
   If a user wants to add a branch for a new node, they can select “Add a Branch”, which opens a selection screen to choose a node for the new branch.

## 3. **Unlink**  
   If a user wants to remove the connection between two nodes, they can select “Unlink” to disconnect the nodes and break the existing link between them.

## 4. **Link**  
   If a user wants to connect two nodes, they can drag a connection from one node and attach it to another node, creating a new link between them.

# Save Workflows

The Save Workflow option lets you save any changes made to your workflow. Whenever you add, remove, or edit something, click Save to keep your latest updates. This ensures your workflow stays up to date and nothing gets lost.

### What if you forget to save the changes?

If you forget to save the changes, appse ai will show a pop-up message before you leave the page.

It will ask whether you want to save the changes or leave without saving, so you don’t accidentally lose your work.

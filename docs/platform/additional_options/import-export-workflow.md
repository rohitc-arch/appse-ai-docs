# Import or Export Workflow

The Import/Export functionality in appse ai allows teams to share and reuse workflows across different organizations or projects easily. Instead of rebuilding workflows from scratch, users can export an existing workflow as a JSON file and import it into another account or workspace.

This feature helps teams save time, reduce duplication, and maintain consistency in their automation processes. It promotes collaboration by allowing workflows to be shared seamlessly across departments, ensuring faster and more efficient workflow management.

### How to Import a workflow

1. Open the **three-dot menu** in the floating sidebar and select **Import Workflow**.

### Importing a workflow where there’s already a workflow

If you try to **import a workflow** while another workflow is already present on the canvas, a **confirmation pop-up** will appear asking whether you want to **replace the existing workflow** with the new one.
